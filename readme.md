# Frontend Mentor - Tic Tac Toe solution

This is a solution to the [Tic Tac Toe challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tic-tac-toe-game-Re7ZF_E2v). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

I'm realy not proud of the code (it's realy terrible), might redo it in the future, also didn't do the bonus challenges :c

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win
